Welcome to Fiasco 1.2!
----------------------

Fiasco is a microkernel intended to be compatible with the L4 microkernel
for x86. It implements the L4 ABI as defined in the L4/x86 Reference Manual,
which can be found at: http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/L4/bib.html

The Fiasco kernel can be used to construct flexible systems. We at TU Dresden
use it as a base for our DROPS system which supports running real-time
and time-sharing applications concurrently on one system. However, Fiasco
is not only suitable for big and complex systems, but also for small,
embedded applications.

This distribution contains the Fiasco 1.2 microkernel and tools to build
it. User level applications are not included in this package.

Licensing
---------

Fiasco is freely redistributable under the GPL (see l4/kernel/fiasco/COPYING).

This is a closed list, proper mails will be let through by the moderator.

Supported architectures and ABIs
--------------------------------

  * IA32 (Intel, AMD and compatible CPUs, i486 and above)
  * ARM  (SA1110 and PXA)
  * UX   (Linux usermode emulation of Fiasco/L4)

  The following L4 ABIs are supported by the IA32 and UX variants:

  * L4/v2 (stable version 2)
  * L4/x0 (experimental version 0)

  The ARM variant of Fiasco supports the L4/x0 L4 ABI.

A list of changes since the last release can be found in the CHANGES file.

Building the Fiasco kernel
--------------------------

To compile Fiasco you need gcc 3.3, 3.4 or 4.0, a recent version of GNU
binutils, GNU make and Perl version 5.6 or later. For the configuration tool
you also need Python version 2.

Change to the directory fiasco-1.2/l4/kernel/fiasco/ and
create a build directory with "make BUILDDIR=build" and change to the
'build' directory. Optionally modify the default configuration using
"make menuconfig". Then compile the kernel by typing "make".

The kernel image can then be found in fiasco-1.2/l4/kernel/fiasco/build/ as
'fiasco'.

Mailing List
------------

For problem reports and suggestions regarding the Fiasco microkernel,
please subscribe and send mail to the l4-hackers mailing list:

Remote CVS
----------

The latest development versions are available from our Remote-CVS server.
The truly bleeding edge will want to check out daily snapshots from there.
However, be aware that these may not always run correctly.
You can also get user land programs for L4 from this Remote-CVS.

For information how to use Remote-CVS see:

Enjoy!
