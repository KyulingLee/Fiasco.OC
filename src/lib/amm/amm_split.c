/*
 * Split an address map entry into two pieces
 */
#include <errno.h>

/*
 * Called whenever the AMM needs to split an entry due to conflicting flags.
 * Calls the user-set split routine if available.  Otherwise performs a
 * simple split here.  Either should split the entries and return zero or
 * return non-zero if the split could not be done.  A non-zero return value
 * is propogated on to whoever performed the action which triggered the split
 * request.
 *
 * ``pentry'' is a pointer to the next field of the entry previous to the
 * one being split.
 *
 * ``entry'' is the entry to be split.
 *
 * ``addr'' is the address at which the split should be made.  Addr is
 * guarenteed to fall in the range of the entry.
 *
 * ``headp'' and ``tailp'' should be set to everything before addr and
 * everything from addr on respectively.  One or both of *headp and *tailp
 * will be a new entry allocated and initialized here or in the user split
 * routine.  If both are new entries, we deallocate the original entry.
 *
 * This routine links the new entries into the map list.
