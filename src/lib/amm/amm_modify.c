/*
 * The big cheese.
 * Modifies an address range to be associated with a new entry and new flags.
 * Any existing entries wholly within the range are deleted, any that partly
 * overlap the range are split as necessary.  After adding the new entry,
 * the amm may attempt to join it with adjacent already-existing entries if
 * it appears possible (i.e., if the flags words are the same).  The standard
 * amm_join function is called in this case.
 *
 * Function returns zero if successful, non-zero if a split failed (e.g.,
 * due to lack of memory).
 * 
 * Parameters addr and size define the range to be modified.
 *
 * nflags is the new flags for the range.
 *
 * Nentry is the new entry to use.  nentry may be zero, in which case the amm
 * allocates a new standard entry itself.  If nentry is non-zero, the caller
 * must have already allocated any extra attribate data in the entry.  In
 * either case, the amm will initialize the private part of the new amm_entry,
 * including setting its address range type flags to the nflags parameter.
