 * One-time initialization for AMM
 */
#include "amm.h"

/*
 * Initialize the given amm structure, and associates the specified
 * flags and entry with the entire supported address range 0 through
 * (vm_offset_t)-1.
 *
 * The flags parameter is the address range flags word to associate
 * initially with the entire address space.
 *
 * The entry parameter allows the client to provide the initial amm_entry
 * node which will initially be associated with the entire address space;
 * this way the client can allocate a structure larger than the basic
 * amm_entry and store additional attribute data in the extended structure.
 * If the client supplies the init_entry, it must have initialized any
 * client-private data in that entry, but the amm will initialize the
 * amm-private part (the actual struct amm_entry).  If entry is NULL,
 * the amm will call amm_alloc_entry to allocate a struct amm_entry and
 * initialize that.
 *
 * If the client wants to perform allocation or deallocation (or whatever)
 * over only a subset of the full possible (32- or 64-bit) address range,
 * then it can set up the init_entry to represent "invalid"
 * addresses rather than "free" addresses, and then later call
 * amm_modify_range() to create appropriate "free" region(s).
